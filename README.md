# previous-data-science-work
Repository of previous papers, pdfs, and notebooks of class assignments and projects.

This primarily consists of projects from my datascience classes at the University of Chicago, and North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). 
Higher in the repository holds more recent work, from UChicago 
Most of work from NCSSM are simple notebooks, however there are some interesting projects I worked on


I am currently working on updating this repository with all files and datasets used for these documents by looking through old hardrives and computers.
Files will be updated overtime as more are found.

Note: Much of the Work from High school is rudimentary, and there are easy improvements that can be made
