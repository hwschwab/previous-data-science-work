# previous-data-science-work
Repository of previous papers, pdfs, and notebooks of class assignments and projects.

This primarily consists of projects from my datascience classes at the University of Chicago, and North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). 
Higher in the repository holds more recent work, from UChicago 
Most of work from NCSSM are simple notebooks, however there are some interesting projects I worked on
