# previous-data-science-work
Repository of previous papers, pdfs, and notebooks of class assignments and projects.

Highlights include: Midterm and Final papers, the Cervix Cancer paper, W8MkDwn, W6L2, and the pure visualization plots although I haven't found the relevent datasets quite yet.

This primarily consists of projects from my data science classes at the University of Chicago, and North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). All High school projects were completed using R and R-Markdown, converted to Html and then PDFs for ease of access

I am currently working on updating this repository with all files and datasets used for these documents by looking through old hardrives and computers.
Files will be updated overtime as files are arefound.

Note: Most of work from NCSSM are simple notebooks with obvious flaws, however there are some interesting projects I worked on.
